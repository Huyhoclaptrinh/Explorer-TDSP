# Explorer TDSP

## Project Overview
This project explores data related to the Traveler Data Specification Program (TDSP). It aims to analyze, visualize, and provide insights into traffic patterns and related datasets. This work is part of an initiative by the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub and the National Student Data Corps in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.

## Background
The TDSP project focuses on utilizing big data to enhance transportation systems. By analyzing traffic data, the project seeks to improve roadway efficiency, safety, and sustainability. The dataset provides insights into traffic flow, incidents, and other transportation metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

## How to Use
This notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Load the Dataset:**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv("path/to/traffic_data.csv")
   ```

2. **Analyze Traffic Patterns:**
   Use statistical analysis and visualization techniques to identify patterns.
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   data['traffic_volume'].plot(kind='line')
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Generate Insights:**
   Leverage machine learning models to predict traffic trends.
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```
